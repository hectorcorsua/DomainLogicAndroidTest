# Prueba Domain Logic
## Summary
Test app to fin users in github

## Features

- Search users
- See user details

### Notes

The whole application is in Kotlin instead of using java to improve the performance of the project and for simplicity of code, plus java has a poor optimisation.

Other point to use kotlin is to use Google guidelines, that says use kotlin as much as possible because is the new project standard.

Data, domain and presentation are in separate modules to improve the readability of the code and to avoid errors with relationships when importing.

I have made datasource, repository and use case unit testing
